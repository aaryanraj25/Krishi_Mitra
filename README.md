## Idea - Abstract
 
 KrishiMitra is a cutting-edge mobile application designed to address the challenges faced by farmers by providing them with a comprehensive solution that includes crop-specific information, a marketplace, investment portal, crop-disease prediction and weather updates. By leveraging the power of technology, KrishiMitra provides farmers with easy access to essential resources and eliminates the need for physical travel, thereby saving time and increasing efficiency. The app's scalability means that it can be expanded to include additional resources and services in the future, and by integrating an investors portal, it can also connect farmers with potential investors and provide tools for investment management and due diligence. KrishiMitra's goal is to provide farmers with a convenient, reliable, and accessible solution that can help them overcome the challenges they face in their profession and improve their livelihoods.
